# JGBot
Stuff this bot does:
* Pulls replay metadata from Dustforce's API then posts them to its own websocket API with additional data, and the Dustforce discord if it's a top 10 replay or tied with a top 10.
* Posts when a new Dustforce stream goes live to the Dustforce discord.
* Posts when a stream goes live to stream owner's channel, if the streamer asks for it on their channel.
